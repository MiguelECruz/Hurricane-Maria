# Estimating mortality rates in Puerto Rico after Hurricane María

This is the repository dedicated for storing the data and program scripts used in the Python reproduction of R. Irizarry's analysis as described in his blog post "Estimating mortality rates in Puerto Rico after hurricane María using newly released official death counts" and replicating the comparisons made in his team's previous article, "Mortality in Puerto Rico after Hurricane Maria" with the updated mortality data for 2017 provided by the Puerto Rico Health Department on 2018. Said reproduction/replication effort was carried out by the classmates Ildefonso Pacheco, Miguel Cruz, Omar Durand and Isabel Rivera for the Intro. to Data Science (CCOM 3031) course, and can be found described in more detail in the Python notebook found through the following Google Colab [link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1r3B04v8sNm3uhtygPWmw7NsMMgC1zzXr?usp=sharing).
